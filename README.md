- **Python 3** - Runtime environment
- **time** - Timing functions for delays

### Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi** - Single-board computer
- **LED Components** - LED, current-limiting resistor
- **Connecting Wires** - Jumper wires for connections
- **Breadboard** - Optional, for prototyping

## üê≥ Usage Examples

### Basic LED Control

```python
from LEDs import LED
import time

# Initialize LED controller
led = LED()

# Simple on/off operations
led.ledOn(18)      # Turn on LED
time.sleep(1)      # Wait 1 second
led.ledOff(18)     # Turn off LED
```

### LED Blinking Patterns

```python
# Blink LED for specific duration
led.ledTimed(18, 0.5)    # Blink for 0.5 seconds

# Create blinking pattern
for i in range(5):
    led.ledOn(18)
    time.sleep(0.2)
    led.ledOff(18)
    time.sleep(0.2)
```

### Multiple LED Control

```python
# Control multiple LEDs
led_pins = [18, 23, 24, 25]

# Turn on all LEDs
for pin in led_pins:
    led.ledOn(pin)

# Turn off all LEDs
for pin in led_pins:
    led.ledOff(pin)

# Blink all LEDs in sequence
for pin in led_pins:
    led.ledTimed(pin, 0.3)
```

### Integration with Other Projects

```python
class LEDIndicator:
    def __init__(self, pin):
        self.led = LED()
        self.pin = pin
    
    def show_status(self, status):
        """Show status with LED patterns."""
        if status == "success":
            self.led.ledTimed(self.pin, 1.0)  # Long blink
        elif status == "error":
            # Rapid blinking for error
            for _ in range(3):
                self.led.ledTimed(self.pin, 0.2)
        elif status == "warning":
            self.led.ledTimed(self.pin, 0.5)  # Medium blink
```

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Running LED Control

```bash
# Basic operation
python3 -c "
from LEDs import LED
led = LED()
led.ledOn(18)
"

# Test timed operation
python3 -c "
from LEDs import LED
led = LED()
led.ledTimed(18, 2)
"
```

### GPIO Management

```bash
# Check GPIO status
gpio readall

# Monitor GPIO activity
sudo python3 -u -c "
from LEDs import LED
led = LED()
led.ledOn(18)
"

# Clean up GPIO
python3 -c "
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.cleanup()
"
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Run with verbose output
python3 -v -c "
from LEDs import LED
led = LED()
"

# Check LED connections
gpio -g mode 18 out
gpio -g write 18 1
```

## üîç Application Features

## üö® Important Notes

### Safety Considerations

- **Current Limiting**: Always use resistors with LEDs
- **Voltage Levels**: GPIO pins output 3.3V (not 5V)
- **Pin Protection**: Don't exceed 16mA per pin
- **Physical Safety**: Keep hands clear during testing

### Limitations

- **Raspberry Pi Only**: Designed specifically for Raspberry Pi GPIO
- **Single Pin Operations**: Each method operates on one pin at a time
- **Basic Functionality**: Simple on/off and timed operations
- **No PWM**: Basic digital control only

### Best Practices

- **Use Resistors**: Always include current-limiting resistors
- **Check Connections**: Verify LED polarity and connections
- **Test Gradually**: Start with simple operations before complex patterns
- **Clean Up**: Always clean up GPIO when done

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production use, consider:

1. **Multiple LED Support** - Extend for controlling multiple LEDs simultaneously
2. **PWM Control** - Add brightness control with PWM
3. **Pattern Sequences** - Implement complex LED patterns and animations
4. **Status Indicators** - Use LEDs for system status and notifications
5. **Monitoring** - Add LED health monitoring and diagnostics
6. **Configuration Files** - Use configuration files for LED setups
